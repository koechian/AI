# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

A repo for tasks, assignments and everything Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

The 1st digit after the type of resource is the year. (eg: Class Exercise 3.3 would stand for a class exercise I did in 3rd year, and it is the 3rd class exercise)
